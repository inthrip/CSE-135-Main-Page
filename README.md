## Free Choice Third Party Analytics Decision
While parousing for a third party analytics service, the main thing I was paying attention for was the privacy 
offered. Given that we just tested out two quite invasive analytics services, I wanted to try one that marketed
itself on being very privacy-friendly. I was curious to see what the drawbacks/benefits were to providing plenty of privacy.
That's ultimately why I chose Plausible, it touted itself as a privacy-friendly alternative to Google Analytics. 
The first thing I noticed when analyzing Plausible was that it provides no user-level profiling at all. It is impossible
to curtail to the preferences of any individual with this service alone. However, it did provide a simple but useful level of 
analytics filterability for what you could measure and chart, such as funnels, screen size, goals, properties, etc.
It was difficult to determine conclusively, but I would imagine that the lack of maintained cookies and user-profiling likely yields
better performance from the user's end. Overall, it seems that the tradeoff Plausible makes in granting heightened privacy and
performance, but providing zero in the way of adjusting to individual preferences, likely means its best-off serving websites 
who's users stay a very short time, visit frequently, and only want the same/similar thing each time, like wordle.
